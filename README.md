# NPS-Campsite-Availabilites-Web-Scraper
The goal of this project is to constantly monitor a list of campgrounds on the National Park Service website for sites with weekend availabilities. If a site has been declared reservable for friday/saturday evenings in the next 30 days lookahead, an email with a reservation link will be sent to the email(s) listed.
